## ✅ **Issues Resolved & Implemented**

### 1. **Missing User Transaction Endpoints** - ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Previous Issue**: The plan specified user transaction endpoints (`POST /transactions/earn`, `POST /transactions/redeem`) but these were not implemented in the user controller.

**Solution Implemented**:
```typescript
// apps/api/src/coins/controllers/coin-transaction.controller.ts
@Post('earn')
async createEarnRequest(@Body() earnDto: CreateEarnRequestDto, @Request() req)

@Post('redeem')
async createRedeemRequest(@Body() redeemDto: CreateRedeemRequestDto, @Request() req)
```

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Mobile app can now submit earn/redeem requests as intended.

### 2. **Data Alignment Issues** - ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Previous Issue**: The `createTransaction` method in the service expected a generic DTO but the business logic methods had different parameter signatures.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created specific DTOs: `CreateEarnRequestDto` and `CreateRedeemRequestDto`
- Updated controller to use specific business logic methods
- Fixed parameter signatures and validation

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Consistent interfaces across all layers.

### 3. **Missing Transaction Validation Service Integration** - ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Previous Issue**: The `TransactionValidationService` existed but was not integrated into the main transaction flow.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Integrated validation service into earn and redeem request methods
- Added proper validation before transaction processing
- Consistent business rule enforcement

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Validation service now properly integrated.

### 4. **Incomplete Mobile App Implementation** - ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Previous Issue**: Mobile app screens existed but the transaction submission flow was incomplete.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated mobile transaction service to use correct API endpoints
- Fixed mobile app store to use proper types and schemas
- Completed earn and redeem screen implementations
- Proper error handling and form validation

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Mobile app now fully functional with API integration.

### 5. **Missing Admin Portal Integration** - ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Previous Issue**: Admin portal components existed but were not integrated into the main admin pages.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Connected transaction management to admin navigation
- Created admin transactions page with proper integration
- Fixed component interfaces and type errors
- Proper state management and error handling

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Admin portal now fully integrated.
