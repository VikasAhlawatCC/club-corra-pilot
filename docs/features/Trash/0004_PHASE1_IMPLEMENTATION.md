- Exported services for use in other modules

#### Coins Module (`apps/api/src/coins/coins.module.ts`)
- Integrated new validation and balance update services
- Added ConfigModule dependency
- Exported new services for use in controllers

## Default Configuration Values

### Brand Defaults
- **Earning Percentage**: 30% of MRP

## Business Rules Implemented

### Earning Rules
1. Coins immediately added to user balance upon earn request
2. Brand earning caps enforced per user and overall
3. Bill age and amount validation based on global config
4. Fraud prevention time gaps between submissions

### Redemption Rules
1. User must have sufficient coin balance
2. All pending earn requests must be processed first
3. Brand redemption caps enforced per transaction and overall
4. Coins reserved upon redemption request submission

### Validation Rules
1. Bill amounts must meet minimum threshold
2. Bill dates cannot be in the future
3. Bill age must be within configured limit
4. Fraud prevention time gaps between submissions

## Technical Architecture

### Database Design
- **Normalized Schema**: Proper relationships between entities
- **Performance Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive tracking of all changes
