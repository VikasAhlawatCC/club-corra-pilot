# Phase 4: Testing Implementation

## Overview
Phase 4 implements comprehensive testing for the authentication system across all platforms (API, Mobile, Shared). This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing scenarios.

## Test Infrastructure Setup

### 1. Jest Configuration
- **API (NestJS)**: Jest with ts-jest preset, configured for Node.js environment
- **Mobile (React Native)**: Jest with ts-jest preset, configured for jsdom environment with React Native mocks
- **Shared Package**: Jest with ts-jest preset, configured for Node.js environment

### 2. Test Dependencies Added
```json
// API and Shared packages
"jest": "^29.5.0",
"@types/jest": "^29.5.2",
"ts-jest": "^29.1.0"

// Mobile package
"react-test-renderer": "18.2.0"
```

## Test Scenarios

### 1. API Integration Testing
```bash
# Run API tests
cd apps/api
yarn test

# Run with coverage
yarn test:cov

# Run specific test file
yarn test auth.controller.spec.ts
```

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- All authentication endpoints (signup, login, verify OTP, refresh token, logout)
- OTP generation and verification across SMS and email
- JWT token management and refresh mechanism
- Rate limiting and validation
- Error handling and response formatting

### 2. Mobile-API Integration Testing
```bash
# Run mobile tests
cd apps/mobile
yarn test

# Run with coverage
yarn test:cov

# Run specific test file
yarn test auth.service.test.ts
```

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- API service integration with real endpoints
- OTP input and verification flow
- Profile data synchronization
- Payment details storage and retrieval
- Error handling and user feedback

### 3. End-to-End Testing
```bash
# Run shared package tests
cd packages/shared
yarn test

# Run integration tests
yarn test:integration
```

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- Complete user signup flow validation
- Cross-platform schema compatibility
- Data type consistency across platforms
- International format support
- Error message consistency

## Test Data and Mocking

### Mock Services
- **SMS Service**: Mocked for OTP delivery testing
- **Email Service**: Mocked for OTP delivery testing
- **Database**: Mocked repositories for data persistence testing
- **External APIs**: Mocked fetch calls for network testing

### Test Data Sets
- **Valid Data**: Complete and minimal valid signup data
- **Invalid Data**: Various validation failure scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs
- **International Data**: Different phone formats and locales

## Quality Assurance

### Code Coverage Targets
- **API**: >90% coverage for controllers and services
- **Shared**: >95% coverage for schemas and utilities
- **Mobile**: >80% coverage for components and services

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function and component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Service and component interaction testing
- **Schema Tests**: Data validation and type checking
- **Error Tests**: Failure scenario and edge case testing

## Running Tests

### Individual Package Testing
```bash
# Test API only
yarn workspace @club-corra/api test

# Test mobile only
yarn workspace @club-corra/mobile test

# Test shared package only
yarn workspace @shared/shared test
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests across packages
yarn test

# Run with coverage
yarn test:cov

# Run in watch mode
yarn test:watch
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks (via Husky)
yarn lint && yarn typecheck && yarn test

# CI pipeline
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test:cov
```

## Test Maintenance

### Best Practices
1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent
2. **Mock Management**: Clear and consistent mocking strategies
3. **Data Setup**: Reusable test data and fixtures
4. **Error Testing**: Comprehensive error scenario coverage
5. **Performance**: Tests should run quickly and efficiently

### Test Updates
- Update tests when API contracts change
- Maintain test data consistency across platforms
- Regular review of test coverage and quality
- Update mocks when external dependencies change

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **E2E Testing**: Add Playwright or Detox for full app testing
2. **Performance Testing**: Add load and stress testing for API
3. **Security Testing**: Add penetration testing for authentication flows
4. **Visual Testing**: Add screenshot testing for mobile components
5. **Contract Testing**: Add API contract validation tests

### Monitoring and Reporting
1. **Coverage Reports**: Automated coverage reporting in CI
2. **Test Metrics**: Track test execution time and success rates
3. **Quality Gates**: Enforce minimum coverage thresholds
4. **Test Analytics**: Monitor test performance and reliability

## Conclusion

Phase 4 provides a comprehensive testing foundation for the authentication system, ensuring:
- **Reliability**: Consistent behavior across all platforms
- **Quality**: High test coverage and error handling
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured and documented tests
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend and maintain as features grow

The testing infrastructure supports the development workflow and ensures code quality before deployment, meeting the project's CI/CD requirements and quality standards.
