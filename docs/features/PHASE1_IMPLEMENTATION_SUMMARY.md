# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 1 of the Corra Coins Earn/Redeem System has been successfully implemented, focusing on the data layer and backend services. This phase establishes the foundation for transaction approval workflows, payment processing, and real-time updates.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Brand Schema Updates ✅
- **Updated default values** in `packages/shared/src/schemas/brand.schema.ts`:
  - `earningPercentage`: Changed from 30% to **10%** (as per requirements)
  - `redemptionPercentage`: Changed from 100% to **30%** (as per requirements)
  - `minRedemptionAmount`: Kept at **1** (already correct)
  - `maxRedemptionAmount`: Kept at **2000** (already correct)
  - `brandwiseMaxCap`: Kept at **2000** (already correct)

- **Updated brand entity** in `apps/api/src/brands/entities/brand.entity.ts`:
  - Applied the same default value changes to match the schema

- **Created migration** `1700000000008-UpdateBrandDefaults.ts`:
  - Updates existing brands with new default values
  - Only affects brands that haven't been customized
  - Provides rollback capability

### 2. Transaction Approval Service ✅
**File**: `apps/api/src/coins/services/transaction-approval.service.ts`

**Key Features**:
- **Earn Transaction Approval**: Adds coins to user balance, updates transaction status
- **Earn Transaction Rejection**: No coins added, updates status with admin notes
- **Redeem Transaction Approval**: Checks pending earn requests, deducts coins, updates status
- **Redeem Transaction Rejection**: No coins deducted, updates status with admin notes
- **Payment Processing**: Marks redeem transactions as paid with transaction ID
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides pending transaction counts and statistics

**Business Logic**:
- Redeem requests can only be approved after all pending earn requests are resolved
- Uses database transactions for data consistency
- Updates user balances in real-time
- Provides comprehensive transaction statistics

### 3. Payment Processing Service ✅
**File**: `apps/api/src/coins/services/payment-processing.service.ts`

**Key Features**:

- Provides real-time WebSocket updates
- Maintains data consistency across services
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 7. Admin API Endpoints ✅
**File**: `apps/api/src/coins/controllers/coin-admin.controller.ts`

**New Endpoints**:
- `GET /admin/coins/transactions/pending` - Get pending transactions
- `PUT /admin/coins/transactions/:id/approve` - Approve earn transactions
- `PUT /admin/coins/transactions/:id/reject` - Reject earn transactions
- `PUT /admin/coins/transactions/:id/approve-redeem` - Approve redeem transactions
- `PUT /admin/coins/transactions/:id/reject-redeem` - Reject redeem transactions
- `PUT /admin/coins/transactions/:id/process-payment` - Process payments
- `GET /admin/coins/stats/transactions` - Get transaction statistics
- `GET /admin/coins/stats/payments` - Get payment statistics
- `GET /admin/coins/payments/:id/summary` - Get payment summary

**Features**:
- Full CRUD operations for transaction management
- Comprehensive statistics and reporting
- Proper error handling and logging
- RESTful API design

### 8. Module Configuration ✅
**File**: `apps/api/src/coins/coins.module.ts`

**Updates**:
- Added `TransactionApprovalService` to providers and exports
- Added `PaymentProcessingService` to providers and exports
- Maintained existing service dependencies

## Technical Architecture

### Service Layer
```
CoinsService (Main Service)
├── TransactionApprovalService (Approval Logic)
├── PaymentProcessingService (Payment Logic)
├── TransactionValidationService (Validation Logic)
└── ConnectionManager (Real-time Updates)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Transaction Creation** → Validation → Pending Status
2. **Admin Review** → Approval/Rejection → Status Update
3. **Real-time Updates** → WebSocket → User/Admin Notification
4. **Payment Processing** → Transaction ID → Paid Status

### Database Transactions
- All approval/rejection operations use database transactions
- Ensures data consistency across multiple table updates
- Rollback capability on errors

## Business Rules Implemented

### Earn Transaction Rules ✅
- Admin can approve earn requests by reviewing receipt, MRP, and date
- Admin can reject earn requests with required notes
- Coins are added to user balance only after approval
- No coins are added on rejection

### Redeem Transaction Rules ✅
- Admin can only approve redeem requests after all pending earn requests are resolved
- Admin must process payment manually and enter transaction ID
- Coins are deducted from user balance on approval
- Transaction status progresses: PENDING → PROCESSED → PAID

### Validation Rules ✅
- User must have sufficient balance for redemption
- Redemption amount must be within brand limits
- Bill amount and date validation
- Duplicate submission prevention

## Real-time Features

### User Notifications ✅
- Instant balance updates
- Transaction status changes
- Approval/rejection notifications
- Payment completion confirmations

### Admin Dashboard ✅
- Live pending request counts
- Real-time transaction updates

- User ID tracking for audit purposes
- Proper authorization checks

### Data Validation ✅
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Business rule enforcement
- SQL injection prevention through TypeORM
- XSS protection through proper data sanitization

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization ✅
- Proper indexing on transaction queries
- Efficient pagination for large datasets
- Optimized joins for related data
- Transaction batching for bulk operations

### WebSocket Efficiency ✅
- Connection pooling and management
- Event-based updates (no polling)
- Efficient message routing
- Connection cleanup on disconnect

## Next Steps (Phase 2A & 2B)

- Database migration testing

## Deployment Notes

### Database Migration
- Run migration `1700000000008-UpdateBrandDefaults.ts` before deployment
- Test migration on staging environment first
