## Technical Implementation Details

### OTP Verification State Structure
```typescript
otpVerificationState: {
  isVerifying: boolean;           // Current verification status
  attemptsRemaining: number;      // Remaining OTP attempts (3 max)
  lastAttemptTime: number | null; // Timestamp of last attempt
  isResendAvailable: boolean;     // Whether resend is allowed
  resendCooldown: number;         // Cooldown timer in seconds
  verificationMethod: 'SMS' | 'EMAIL' | null; // Current method
}
```

### Registration Flow State Structure
```typescript
registrationState: {
  step: 'MOBILE' | 'OTP' | 'EMAIL' | 'PROFILE' | 'PASSWORD' | 'COMPLETE';
  mobileVerified: boolean;        // Mobile number verification status
  emailVerified: boolean;         // Email verification status
  profileComplete: boolean;       // Profile setup completion
  passwordSet: boolean;           // Password setup completion
}
```

### Session Management State Structure
```typescript
sessionState: {
  lastActivity: number;           // Timestamp of last user activity
  isSessionValid: boolean;        // Current session validity
  autoRefreshEnabled: boolean;    // Token auto-refresh status
  refreshTokenExpiry: number | null; // Refresh token expiry
}
```

- Enhanced `resendOTP()` with cooldown management

#### Registration Flow Methods
- `updateRegistrationState(updates)` - Update registration progress
- `resetRegistrationState()` - Reset registration to initial state
- Automatic state progression on successful operations

#### Session Management Methods
- `updateSessionState(updates)` - Update session state
- `trackActivity()` - Track user activity for session validity
- `isSessionValid()` - Check if session is still valid
- Enhanced token refresh with state updates
